- I am doclan. I have made considerable contributions to the reverse engineering of various parts of vrchat in the past (participated in the avatar ripping project).
- I started reverse engineering vrchat in 2017. But on 10/23/2023, after discussing with a member of an organization related to vrchat reverse engineering,
- I decided to delete all related accounts and all content. I restarted with name doclan and am currently creating VRCPirate.
- I will not post anything outside VRCPirate range.
